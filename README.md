# Longer intro of AShutosh K (ASK)
Hi, I am Ashutosh and code that I have written is used by 2 startups and even a decade old company, in production.

I co-founded BloqSecure Technologies Pvt. Ltd. and worked in MetaMaap and LifeSignals inc. apart from my PS 

Skills I picked up include fullstack development, cloud computing, cybersecurity and more. 

I coded and deployed the entire MVP in my startup, BloqSecure, using node.js and AWS. 
In Metamaap, I rewrote the entire code a day before an important demo with an exam the next day.

Even in LifeSignals, a 10+ year old company, my code is used in their application in production. I made a 10 minute setup process into a 10 second run and forget process

One of my most relevant projects include a WhatsApp chatbot that could use ChatGPT. It got 200+ users in a week through word of mouth alone. I learnt what kind of features people wanted and added or removed features based on user responses. I also learnt how to scale here. The bot crashed on 2 users on day 1 but handled 40 users simultaneously on day 7

One unique thing about me is that I went through every review about BiteSpeed on Shopify and categorised what the review was about after scraping it. Almost every review was positive and I can really see the potential of BiteSpeed. I genuinely want to be a part of the team at BiteSpeed

If you add me to your team, you will have a developer who has solved real problems in scalability, automation, security etc. with experience working in startups and holding industry recognised certifications such as CompTIA Security+
