The free plan allows to make a first direct contact with customers and to be closer to them, it's essential to build customer loyalty. Possibility to customize the popup and the different tools, simple and intuitive configuration. The support is reactive and helpful, Vinayak personalized a message for me (impossible to do it from the app interface). I would probably opt for the paid plan with retargeting of abandoned shopping carts in a while.

The number of opt-in options and campaign styles are just the right amount and are very easy to set up. I truly have seen extra $$$ because of this app and the analytics are precise to the point where I can see what is working and what needs some editing to increase the click-through rate.

Since then, I landed with a few issues with setting up the apps but the technical team is always there to assist me. Usually they will reply within a few hours. At first, I uninstall the apps after 3 days of use as there is still some confusion on how it works but an email from them convinced me to a 2nd try. Now after 3 weeks of using this apps, I found that my opt in rate around 2% and I was able to convert some of these subscribers to customers! Give it a try, I am sure it will help you in some way.

So many functions and so easy to use and customise. The pop-up function is really good and non-intrusive and it is not annoying like what some other apps provide. The support team is amazing too!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | -                        | Support, user friendly, pop-up function                                            | nan                                                                                                                        |

Remarketing and Preventing Abandon Carts are the most important things I think when doing online ecommerce.  Having days of  14 add to carts with only 1 purchase for the whole day is tough. Also a customer that have concerning questions about a item can lead to those visits but no purchases. If you cant answer the customers concerns then why should they order from you? This app actually helps to solve those problems that occur to every new and experience seller.  You are able to answer those concerns on live and capture those abandon carts via FB.  Their Team actually helps and really likes to find out how they can help and grow your sales. This also includes any ideas you would like to see them create for the existing app. Vinayak also gives great suggestions on using FB ads to grow your business and other helpful reviews of your site to create more conversions.

| Star Wars General                                                    | United States  | 5 months using the app       |       5 | This app is going to scale my business and I'm excited about it and recommend everyone else get this tool. As someone who just recently was introduced to drop-shipping I've personally done thousands in my recent weeks but didn't know much re-targeting and creating a appealing web-store. Two of the tools I now know are needed for success are a wheel spinner and a FB messenger for re-targeting. This app here has both and I couldn't be more happier. Guys if you've been for the tools needed to grow your business look no further. BiteSpeed has it all, not include great customer service who will be with you very step of the way. I'm glad to have discovered this app and would recommend it to everyone who plans on taking their business to the next level. 5 out of 5 Stars!!!                                                                                                                                                               | -                        | Support, wheel spinner, FB messenger                                               | nan                                                                                                                        |

Moreover, the spin the wheel option has been a very successful opt in tool. We have tried Recart & Shopmessage but none of them were able to provide us with the results that BiteSpeed has. The conversion rate through their opt in as well as follow up tool are well over 10% for us. Most importantly though, the support team is extremely responsive and efficient. They help resolve even the smallest query extremely quickly. The app is also free for the moment so would definitely recommend everyone take advantage of it while they can. Truly worth the switch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | -                        | Support, ROI                                                                       | nan                                                                                                                        |

Andere opties zijn ook leuk, maar niet meer gratis. === First app on whatsapp you can install on the helpdesk! And there are no other options available, but it doesn't cost me anything.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | -                        | Free-to-start                                                                      | nan                                                                                                                        |
| Designstoff                                                          | Norway         | 3 months using the app       |       1 | I wouldn´t even give this app 1 star. Their app is not working and I have been waiting months. There are so many bugs within their app it´s ridiculous. I have lost so much money waiting for them to fix their app. It is not working. Don´t waist your time editing all fields and forms here - because it´s simply not working. They don´even respond to some of the emails. I have never experienced this before except with one other app provider.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | -                        | -                                                                                  | "Bugs"                                                                                                                     |
